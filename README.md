This repository provides the **official PyTorch implementation** of our NeurIPS 2025 paper:

> **"GyroAtt: Towards a General Attention Framework on Gyrovector Spaces for Matrix Manifolds"**

---

### 🧭 Overview

**GyroAtt** generalizes the self-attention mechanism from Euclidean spaces to **gyrovector spaces**, enabling a unified design for diverse **matrix manifolds** including **SPD**, **SPSD**, and **Grassmann**.
It introduces:

The code will be released soon.
